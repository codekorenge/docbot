My father, or Appa as we lovingly called him, would have been 95 today, on Sept 10, 2024.
His absence has left a profound void in our lives, one that can never be filled.Born in
Sentul on Sept 10, 1929, my father, the late R. Solomon Samuel, lived through the Japanese
Occupation in Malaya. During those difficult years, he worked in a sawmill in Batu Arang,
bringing home a sack of rice on his shoulders each week. This act of love and sacrifice ensured
that his family – his father, the Rev L.A. Samuel, his mother K. Elizabeth, and their 16
children – could eat rice instead of tapioca, which caused beriberi, a severe malnutrition disease.

His funeral, held on Oct 5, saw over 500 people filling the 300-seat church, with hundreds more
paying their respects at our home. Appa was a loving father who always took care of us, even
nursing us back to health when we were sick. He brought home athletes from SKGPM, letting them rest
at our home during the West Seremban District Athletics Championships (MSSDSB). Some of my fondest
memories are of our evening walks as a family to the Seremban Lake Gardens. My father would carry
my little sister Anne on his shoulders. We had a dog named Ringo which alerted us every time a
python crept under our house which stood on stilts. We also reared chickens and ducks. The lessons
my father taught us remain etched in our minds.
